# residrill_MS

This repository contains the data and R code to reproduce all analyses of our paper entitled "Rotten to the core? Drivers of the vertical profile and accumulation of internal tree stem damage". In this paper we use a resistograph drill to measure the vertical profile of internal tree stem damage. We also test how tree size, wood density, external termite presence, and basal fire scarring affects the accumulation of damage within living trees. 

All code is inside the R directory.
